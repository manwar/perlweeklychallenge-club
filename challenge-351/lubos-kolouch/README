# Perl Weekly Challenge 349 Solutions

Perl and Python implementations for both tasks of Weekly Challenge 349.

## Task 1: Power String

Compute the length of the longest run of identical characters inside a string.

- **Perl (`perl/ch-1.pl`)**: Validates input with Type::Tiny, iterates once
  over the characters, and reports the maximum run length together with inline
  Test::More coverage for the five specification examples.
- **Python (`python/ch-1.py`)**: Mirrors the single-pass logic with full type
  annotations and the same tests implemented via `unittest`.

## Task 2: Meeting Point

Track a path built from the moves `U`, `D`, `L`, and `R` and determine whether
you ever return to the origin while following the steps.

- **Perl (`perl/ch-2.pl`)**: Streams the instructions with type validation,
  updating a coordinate accumulator and returning once the origin is revisited;
  bundled tests assert the supplied scenarios.
- **Python (`python/ch-2.py`)**: Implements equivalent logic with typed
  movement deltas and a `unittest` suite containing the specification cases.

## Running the Solutions

- **Perl**: `perl perl/ch-1.pl` or `perl perl/ch-2.pl`
- **Python**: `python3 python/ch-1.py` or `python3 python/ch-2.py`
- Each script runs only the official example cases as unit tests.
