# Perl Weekly Challenge 322 Solutions

Perl and Python implementations for both tasks of Weekly Challenge 322.

## Task 1: String Format

Remove dashes from the input string and regroup characters into chunks of the
requested size, grouped from the end (the first group can be shorter).

- **Perl (`perl/ch-1.pl`)**: Removes dashes, slices from the end and joins with
  dashes, with embedded Test::More tests for the examples.
- **Python (`python/ch-1.py`)**: Equivalent logic with type annotations and a
  `unittest` suite containing the official examples.

## Task 2: Rank Array

Return ranks for each integer where the smallest value has rank 1 and ties
share the same rank.

- **Perl (`perl/ch-2.pl`)**: Builds a value->rank map from the sorted unique
  values and maps it back to the original list, with Test::More example tests.
- **Python (`python/ch-2.py`)**: Uses `sorted(set(...))` and a mapping dict,
  tested via `unittest` with the provided examples.

## Running the Solutions

- **Perl**: `perl perl/ch-1.pl` or `perl perl/ch-2.pl`
- **Python**: `python3 python/ch-1.py` or `python3 python/ch-2.py`
- Each script runs only the official example cases as unit tests.
