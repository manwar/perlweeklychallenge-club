# Perl Weekly Challenge 350 Solutions

Perl and Python implementations for both tasks of Weekly Challenge 350.

## Task 1: Good Substrings

Return the number of good substrings of length three (no repeated characters).

- **Perl (`perl/ch-1.pl`)**: Slides a 3-character window and counts distinct
  triplets; includes Test::More coverage for all examples.
- **Python (`python/ch-1.py`)**: Uses a 3-character window and `set()` to test
  uniqueness, with `unittest` cases from the spec.

## Task 2: Shuffle Pairs

Count integers in a range that belong to at least `count` different shuffle
pairs.

- **Perl (`perl/ch-2.pl`)**: Uses a sorted-digit signature and tries witnesses
  `k` that keep the product within the same digit length; includes Test::More
  checks for the provided examples.
- **Python (`python/ch-2.py`)**: Same signature approach and `unittest` cases
  matching the specification.

## Running the Solutions

- **Perl**: `perl perl/ch-1.pl` or `perl perl/ch-2.pl`
- **Python**: `python3 python/ch-1.py` or `python3 python/ch-2.py`
- Each script runs only the official example cases as unit tests.
