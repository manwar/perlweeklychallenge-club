# Perl Weekly Challenge 303 Solutions

Perl and Python implementations for both tasks of Weekly Challenge 303.

## Task 1: 3-digits Even

Return all distinct even 3-digit integers that can be formed from the given
digits.

- **Perl (`perl/ch-1.pl`)**: Builds numbers from digit counts and de-duplicates.
- **Python (`python/ch-1.py`)**: Uses `Counter` and returns sorted unique values.

## Task 2: Delete and Earn

Maximize points by picking a value `v` to earn `v` points and deleting all
`v-1` and `v+1` values. Equivalent to a DP over value space.

- **Perl (`perl/ch-2.pl`)**: DP like “house robber” over values.
- **Python (`python/ch-2.py`)**: Same DP using `Counter`.

## Running the Solutions

- **Perl**: `perl perl/ch-1.pl` or `perl perl/ch-2.pl`
- **Python**: `python3 python/ch-1.py` or `python3 python/ch-2.py`
- Each script runs only the official example cases as unit tests.
