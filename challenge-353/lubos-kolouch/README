# Perl Weekly Challenge 352 Solutions

Perl and Python implementations for both tasks of Weekly Challenge 352.

## Task 1: Match String

Return all words that appear as substrings of another word in the list,
preserving the first-occurrence order.

- **Perl (`perl/ch-1.pl`)**: Uses Type::Tiny validation and checks each word
  against all other words via substring matching; includes Test::More coverage
  for all five examples.
- **Python (`python/ch-1.py`)**: Type-annotated implementation with a
  `unittest` suite matching the provided examples.

## Task 2: Binary Prefix

For each prefix of a binary digit array, determine whether the corresponding
binary value is divisible by `5`.

- **Perl (`perl/ch-2.pl`)**: Maintains the running remainder modulo 5 to avoid
  big integers, and asserts all examples with Test::More.
- **Python (`python/ch-2.py`)**: Uses the same modulo approach and verifies
  the provided cases via `unittest`.

## Running the Solutions

- **Perl**: `perl perl/ch-1.pl` or `perl perl/ch-2.pl`
- **Python**: `python3 python/ch-1.py` or `python3 python/ch-2.py`
- Each script runs only the official example cases as unit tests.
