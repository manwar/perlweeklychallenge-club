# Perl Weekly Challenge 353 Solutions

Perl and Python implementations for both tasks of Weekly Challenge 353.

## Task 1: Max Words

Return the maximum number of words that appear in a single sentence.

- **Perl (`perl/ch-1.pl`)**: Splits each sentence on whitespace and tracks the
  maximum word count; includes Test::More coverage for all examples.
- **Python (`python/ch-1.py`)**: Uses `str.split()` to count words and verifies
  the official examples via `unittest`.

## Task 2: Validate Coupon

Validate coupon triplets `(code, name, status)` according to the rules in the
specification and return per-entry validity booleans.

- **Perl (`perl/ch-2.pl`)**: Checks the allowed character set, category, and
  status flag; includes Test::More assertions for all examples.
- **Python (`python/ch-2.py`)**: Implements the same validation logic with a
  `unittest` suite matching the examples.

## Running the Solutions

- **Perl**: `perl perl/ch-1.pl` or `perl perl/ch-2.pl`
- **Python**: `python3 python/ch-1.py` or `python3 python/ch-2.py`
- Each script runs only the official example cases as unit tests.
