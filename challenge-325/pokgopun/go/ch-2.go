Task 2: Final Price

Submitted by: [44]Mohammad Sajid Anwar
     __________________________________________________________________

   You are given an array of item prices.

   Write a script to find out the final price of each items in the given
   array.

   There is a special discount scheme going on. If thereâ€™s an item with a
   lower or equal price later in the list, you get a discount equal to
   that later price (the first one you find in order).

Example 1

Input: @prices = (8, 4, 6, 2, 3)
Output: (4, 2, 4, 2, 3)

Item 0:
The item price is 8.
The first time that has price <= current item price is 4.
Final price = 8 - 4 => 4

Item 1:
The item price is 4.
The first time that has price <= current item price is 2.
Final price = 4 - 2 => 2

Item 2:
The item price is 6.
The first time that has price <= current item price is 2.
Final price = 6 - 2 => 4

Item 3:
The item price is 2.
No item has price <= current item price, no discount.
Final price = 2

Item 4:
The item price is 3.
Since it is the last item, so no discount.
Final price = 3

Example 2

Input: @prices = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
Output: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

Example 3

Input: @prices = (7, 1, 1, 5)
Output: (6, 0, 1, 5)

Item 0:
The item price is 7.
The first time that has price <= current item price is 1.
Final price = 7 - 1 => 6

Item 1:
The item price is 1.
The first time that has price <= current item price is 1.
Final price = 1 - 1 => 0

Item 2:
The item price is 1.
No item has price <= current item price, so no discount.
Final price = 1

Item 3:
The item price is 5.
Since it is the last item, so no discount.
Final price = 5
