# Perl Weekly Challenge 282 Solutions

Perl and Python implementations for both tasks of Weekly Challenge 282.

## Task 1: Good Integer

Find the first 3-digit substring that is I<exactly> three consecutive matching
digits (not part of a longer run). Return it or `-1` if it doesn't exist.

- **Perl**: `perl/ch-1.pl`
- **Python**: `python/ch-1.py`

## Task 2: Changing Keys

Count how many times the user changed keys while typing a string, ignoring
case (i.e. shift/caps is not considered a key change).

- **Perl**: `perl/ch-2.pl`
- **Python**: `python/ch-2.py`

## Running

- **Perl**: `perl perl/ch-1.pl` or `perl perl/ch-2.pl`
- **Python**: `python3 python/ch-1.py` or `python3 python/ch-2.py`
- Each script runs only the official example cases as unit tests when run
  without arguments.
