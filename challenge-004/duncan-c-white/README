Challenge 1: "Write a script to output the same number of PI digits
as the size of your script. Say, if your script size is 10, it should
print 3.141592653."

Note that it DOESN'T SAY "calculate the same number of PI digits..." so
I took the liberty to grab the over the internet rather than generate them
on the fly, because generating Pi is so dull.

pi is the full solution, while pi2 and pi are cut down versions to shrink
the size of the program.  Note that all versions take an optional single
command line argument to tell how many digits to print, if absent the default
is to use the size of the script as the question wanted.


Challenge 2: "You are given a file containing a list of words (case
insensitive 1 word per line) and a list of letters. Print each word from
the file than can be made using only letters from the list. You can use
each letter only once (though there can be duplicates and you can use
each of them once), you don't have to use all the letters."

This is a natural "bag of words" question, essentially we need to build
a "bag subset" operation.  See wordbag for the solution, simple and obvious
(I love Perl's hashes especially for their idiomatic set and bag uses).
