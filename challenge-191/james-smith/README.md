# The Weekly Challenge 190

You can find more information about this weeks, and previous weeks challenges at:

  https://theweeklychallenge.org/

If you are not already doing the challenge - it is a good place to practise your
**perl** or **raku**. If it is not **perl** or **raku** you develop in - you can
submit solutions in whichever language you feel comfortable with.

You can find the solutions here on github at:

# Task 1 - Twice Largest

***You are given list of integers, `@list`. Write a script to find out whether the largest item in the list is at least twice as large as each of the other items.***

## Solution

We can simplify the condition to that the largest number is at least twice the value of the second largest number.

Our naive approach could be to sort the numbers and check `$list[-1] >= 2*$list[-2]`.

But this isn't efficient if the list is large - instead we will just track the two largest numbers.

 * We grab the first two numbers, and store the largest one in $f and the other one in $s.
 * For each other number ($_):
   * $_ <= $s - ignore do nothing
   * $s < $_ && $_ <= $f - replace 2nd number $s with $_
   * $f < $_ - replace 2nd number $s with $f, and replace $f with $_
 * Return is based on whether `$f >= 2*$s`

```perl
sub is_double {
  my( $f, $s ) = ( shift, shift );           # First two numbers
  ( $f, $s ) = ( $s, $f ) if $f < $s;        # Switch if 1st < 2nd
  $_>$f ? ( ( $f, $s ) = ( $_, $f ) )        # For each number
        : ( $_ > $s && ( $s = $_ ) ) for @_; #   if > 1st
                                             #     demote 1st to 2nd
                                             #     replace 1st
                                             #   if > 2nd
                                             #     demote 2nd
  $f >= 2*$s ? 1 : -1                        # Check condition
}
```
# Task 2 - Cute List

***You are given an integer, `0 < $n <= 15`. Write a script to find the number of orderings of numbers that form a cute list.***

***With an input `@list = (1, 2, 3, .. $n)` for positive integer `$n`, an ordering of `@list` is cute if for every entry, indexed with a base of 1, either:***

 * ***`$list[$i]` is evenly divisible by `$i`***
 * ***`$i` is evenly divisible by `$list[$i]`***

## Solution

Again this weeks task 2 is a much more interesting challenge. And has a number of different approaches we can find.

 * Do we use recursion - or - interation?
 * Do we memoize or not? if so what key do we use?
 * Are there any simple optimizations - how to make the loop fail earlier?

Firstly - we could use permutations - but this screams out initially at least for recursion.

Before we start some observations:

 * We can pre-compute which numbers can be at which position to give us an array like:

   * `[1,2,3,4,5,6,7]`, `[1,2,4,6]`, `[1,3,6]`, `[1,2,4]`, `[1,5]`, `[1,2,3,6]`, `[1,7]`

 * When we search we can re-order the lists to fill in numbers from the short lists first

   * `[1,5]`, `[1,7]`, `[1,3,6]`, `[1,2,4]`, `[1,2,4,6]`, `[1,2,3,6]`, `[1,2,3,4,5,6,7]`

 * As a bonus - this reduces the search space further as the last list will ALWAYS contain
   a valid digit. So we always know that will return a single value. This allows us the
   shortenings (#1 & #10)

 * Our keys are all integers and less than 64. We can therefore use a bit mask as the keys
   for the cache... {#9 & #11)

   Already placed `2`, `4`, `7` they key would be `10010100`

 * Using a cache can greatly reduce the number of calls (at the expense of memory) see
   #0 & #7. Note we use the `//=` operator here rather than the '||=' as a 0 value
   being cached is as important as a non-zero value and `//=` is a defined check
   rather than a check for true {which `0` would faile}

 * #2, #3 & #4 use a similar {but sort of inverted logic} to a schwartzian transform,
   which we carry over a variable which is important for the sort as a value in an
   array ref only to throw it away with an extra `map`.

 * #8 - we steal `sum0` from `List::Util` but we could equally write our own - to
   avoid the library `sub sum0 { my $t=0; $t+=$_ for @_; $t }`

These observations lead us to the following code...

```perl
my %cache;

sub cute {
    ## (0) Clear cache...
  %cache=();
    ## (1) If n is 1 short cut and return 1
  $_[0]==1 ? 1 : _cute_count( 0,
      ## (2) Just keep the lists
    map  { $_->[1] }
      ## (3) Sort so the shortest lists are first - then sort by integer
    sort { @{$a->[1]} <=> @{$b->[1]} ||
             $a->[0]  <=>   $b->[0]
         }
      ## (4) Find all values between 1 & n which are either a factor or
      ##     multiple. Store each as pair, of the number + all values.
    map  {[ ($a=$_), [
           grep { !( $_%$a && $a%$_ ) } 1 .. $_[0]
         ] ]}
      ## (5) Looping over 1 to n
         1 .. $_[0]
  )
}

sub _cute_count {
  ## (6) We shift of the index number of seen numbers
  ##     and also the next group of possible numbers...
  my( $seen, $next ) = ( shift, shift );
    ## (7) If we have already computed the value return...
    ## (8) otherwise we loop over the values possible in the
    ##     "nth" position (this is loose as they aren't ordered directly)
    ##     by " but by the count {we are only counting so don't need to
    ##     produce numbers}
  $cache{$seen} //= sum0 map {
    ## (9) We sum up the value for each value in this list which hasn't
    ##     been seen (and return it!)
      ($seen & 1<<$_) ? 0
    ## (10) If there is only 1 number left in the list we count 1
    ##     (as all numbers can be in the last position)
    : @_ < 2          ? 1
    ## (11) o/w we call this method again after knocking out the number
    :                   _cute_count( $seen | 1<<$_ , @_ )
  } @{$next}
}
    ## Note we don't use a string as a key - but use a bit mast -
    ## #9 & #11 using "|" to set a bit & "&" to check it has
    ## been set.
```

or without comments:

```perl
sub cute {
  %cache=();
  $_[0]==1 ? 1 : _cute_count( 0,
    map  { $_->[1] }
    sort { @{$a->[1]} <=> @{$b->[1]} ||
             $a->[0]  <=>   $b->[0]
         }
    map  {[ ($a=$_), [
           grep { !( $_%$a && $a%$_ ) } 1 .. $_[0]
         ] ]}
         1 .. $_[0]
  )
}

sub _cute_count {
  my( $seen, $next ) = ( shift, shift );
  $cache{$seen} //= sum0 map {
      ($seen & 1<<$_) ? 0
    : @_ < 2          ? 1
    :                   _cute_count( $seen | 1<<$_ , @_ )
  } @{$next}
}
```
### Performance

We compared this algorithm with various ones with ordering and without we have the following timings:

| Method                      | Rate    | Gain |
| :-------------------------- | ------: | ---: |
| No-cache, no-ordering trick |  1.19/s |      |
| No-cache, ordering trick    |  7.29/s |   6x |
| Cache, no-ordering trick    |  17.4/s |  15x |
| Cache, ordering trick       |  97.0/s |  80x |

The difference expands rapdily as N increases - for `n=20` the optimal solution takes around 0.162 seconds - where the non-optimal solution 96, for an approximately `600x` speed up - this is approx `12x` for the ordering trick & `50x` for the cacheing.

### Timings for increasing `$N`

The original challenge asked us to compute values up to `n=15` - the cumulative time for this is between 1.05 and 1.30 seconds. We can continue on to `n=30` taking around 19 seconds.

The script finally crashes after `n=39` (with a count of around 5.5 trillion) - when the cache memory usage exceeds 7GBytes (the capacity of the machine) and starts to swap. {Note although this machine has more memory it also has a slower processor - so the times are approximately 30% longer than on the box used for the timings above}
