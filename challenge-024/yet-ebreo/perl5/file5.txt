Tell as a Marksman -  were forgotten
Tell -  this Day endures
Ruddy as that coeval Apple
The Tradition bears - 

Fresh as Mankind that humble story
Though a statelier Tale
Grown in the Repetition hoary
Scarcely would prevail - 

Tell had a son -  The ones that knew it
Need not linger here - 
Those who did not to Human Nature
Will subscribe a Tear - 

Tell would not bare his Head
In Presence
Of the Ducal Hat - 
Threatened for that with Death -  by Gessler - 
Tyranny bethought

Make of his only Boy a Target
That surpasses Death - 
Stolid to Love's supreme entreaty
Not forsook of Faith - 

Mercy of the Almighty begging - 
Tell his Arrow sent - 
God it is said replies in Person
When the cry is meant -
