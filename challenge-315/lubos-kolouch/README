# Perl Weekly Challenge 315 Solutions

Perl and Python implementations for both tasks of Weekly Challenge 315.

## Task 1: Find Words

Return the indices of words that contain the given character.

- **Perl (`perl/ch-1.pl`)**: Uses `index` to test each word.
- **Python (`python/ch-1.py`)**: Uses `enumerate` and membership.

## Task 2: Find Third

Return all words that appear immediately after the word pair `(first, second)`
in the given sentence (punctuation is ignored).

- **Perl (`perl/ch-2.pl`)**: Tokenizes and scans consecutive triples.
- **Python (`python/ch-2.py`)**: Tokenizes and scans consecutive triples.

## Running the Solutions

- **Perl**: `perl perl/ch-1.pl` or `perl perl/ch-2.pl`
- **Python**: `python3 python/ch-1.py` or `python3 python/ch-2.py`
- Each script runs only the official example cases as unit tests.
