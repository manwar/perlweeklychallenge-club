# Perl Weekly Challenge 347 Solutions

Perl and Python implementations for both tasks of Weekly Challenge 347.

## Task 1: Format Date

Convert strings like `10th Nov 2025` into ISO form `2025-11-10` while validating
the provided day, month, and year values.

- **Perl (`perl/ch-1.pl`)**: Parses the ordinal components with type-checked
  input and enforces suffix/month/year constraints before formatting.
- **Python (`python/ch-1.py`)**: Uses the same parsing logic with type
  annotations and `unittest` coverage for each provided example.

## Task 2: Format Phone Number

Normalize phone numbers that contain digits, spaces, and dashes by removing
separators and regrouping the digits according to the challenge rules.

- **Perl (`perl/ch-2.pl`)**: Validates allowed characters, strips separators,
  and creates 3-digit blocks with special handling for the trailing digits.
- **Python (`python/ch-2.py`)**: Mirrors the greedy regrouping approach and
  includes type hints plus example-driven unit tests.

## Running the Solutions

- **Perl**: `perl perl/ch-1.pl` or `perl perl/ch-2.pl`
- **Python**: `python3 python/ch-1.py` or `python3 python/ch-2.py`
- Each script runs only the official example cases as unit tests.
