Task 1: Arrays Intersection
Submitted by: Mohammad Sajid Anwar
You are given a list of array of integers.

Write a script to return the common elements in all the arrays.

Example 1
Input: $list = ( [1, 2, 3, 4], [4, 5, 6, 1], [4, 2, 1, 3] )
Output: (1, 4)
Example 2
Input: $list = ( [1, 0, 2, 3], [2, 4, 5] )
Output: (2)
Example 3
Input: $list = ( [1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [6] )
Output: ()

Task 2: Sort Odd Even
Submitted by: Mohammad Sajid Anwar
You are given an array of integers.

Write a script to sort odd index elements in decreasing order and even index elements in increasing order in the given array.

Example 1
Input: @ints = (4, 1, 2, 3)
Output: (2, 3, 4, 1)

Even index elements: 4, 2 => 2, 4 (increasing order)
Odd index elements : 1, 3 => 3, 1 (decreasing order)
Example 2
Input: @ints = (3, 1)
Output: (3, 1)
Example 3
Input: @ints = (5, 3, 2, 1, 4)
Output: (2, 3, 4, 1, 5)

Even index elements: 5, 2, 4 => 2, 4, 5 (increasing order)
Odd index elements : 3, 1 => 3, 1 (decreasing order)
