Task 1: Min Max
Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
You are given an array of distinct integers.

Write a script to find all elements that is neither minimum nor maximum. Return -1 if you canâ€™t.

Example 1
Input: @ints = (3, 2, 1, 4)
Output: (3, 2)

The minimum is 1 and maximum is 4 in the given array. So (3, 2) is neither min nor max.
Example 2
Input: @ints = (3, 1)
Output: -1
Example 3
Input: @ints = (2, 1, 3)
Output: (2)

The minimum is 1 and maximum is 3 in the given array. So 2 is neither min nor max.
