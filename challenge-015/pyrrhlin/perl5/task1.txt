    Write a script to generate first 10 strong and weak prime numbers.

  For example, the nth prime number is represented by p(n).

  p(1) = 2
  p(2) = 3
  p(3) = 5
  p(4) = 7
  p(5) = 11

  Strong Prime number p(n) when p(n) > [ p(n-1) + p(n+1) ] / 2
  Weak   Prime number p(n) when p(n) < [ p(n-1) + p(n+1) ] / 2
