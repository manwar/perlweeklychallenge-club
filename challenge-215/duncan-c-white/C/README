Thought I'd also have a go at translating ch-1.pl and ch-2.pl into C..

Both C versions produce very similar (non-debugging and debugging)
output to the Perl originals.

These C versions use some of my regular support modules:
- my command-line argument processing module args.[ch],
- my csvlist-of-int parsing module parseints.[ch], and
- my int-array printing module printarray.[ch].
