Task 1: Running Sum
Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar

You are given an array of integers.
Write a script to return the running sum of the given array. The running sum can be calculated as sum[i] = num[0] + num[1] + â€¦. + num[i].
Example 1

Input: @int = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
Output: (1, 3, 6, 10, 15)

Example 2

Input: @int = (1, 1, 1, 1, 1)
Output: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

Example 3

Input: @int = (0, -1, 1, 2)
Output: (0, -1, 0, 2)


Task 2: Persistence Sort
Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar

You are given an array of positive integers.
Write a script to sort the given array in increasing order with respect to the count of steps required to obtain a single-digit number by multiplying its digits recursively for each array element. If any two numbers have the same count of steps, then print the smaller number first.
Example 1

Input: @int = (15, 99, 1, 34)
Output: (1, 15, 34, 99)

15 => 1 x 5 => 5 (1 step)
99 => 9 x 9 => 81 => 8 x 1 => 8 (2 steps)
1  => 0 step
34 => 3 x 4 => 12 => 1 x 2 => 2 (2 steps)

Example 2

Input: @int = (50, 25, 33, 22)
Output: (22, 33, 50, 25)

50 => 5 x 0 => 0 (1 step)
25 => 2 x 5 => 10 => 1 x 0 => 0 (2 steps)
33 => 3 x 3 => 9 (1 step)
22 => 2 x 2 => 4 (1 step)
