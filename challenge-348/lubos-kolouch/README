# Perl Weekly Challenge 348 Solutions

Perl and Python implementations for both tasks of Weekly Challenge 348.

## Task 1: String Alike

Split an even-length string into two halves and verify that each half contains
the same, non-zero number of vowels.

- **Perl (`perl/ch-1.pl`)**: Uses typed parameter validation and a single pass
  over each half to count vowels before comparing the totals.
- **Python (`python/ch-1.py`)**: Provides the same logic with type annotations
  and `unittest` coverage of the specification examples.

## Task 2: Convert Time

Determine the minimal number of operations required to turn the source 24-hour
timestamp into the target when you may add 1, 5, 15, or 60 minutes.

- **Perl (`perl/ch-2.pl`)**: Converts stamps to minutes-past-midnight with type
  validation and applies a greedy decomposition over the permitted steps.
- **Python (`python/ch-2.py`)**: Uses the same helper logic, fully typed, along
  with a unittest suite that exercises the provided scenarios.

## Running the Solutions

- **Perl**: `perl perl/ch-1.pl` or `perl perl/ch-2.pl`
- **Python**: `python3 python/ch-1.py` or `python3 python/ch-2.py`
- Each script runs only the official example cases as unit tests.
