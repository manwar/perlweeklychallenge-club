Task 2: Maximise Greatness
Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar

You are given an array of integers.
Write a script to permute the give array such that you get the maximum possible greatness.

To determine greatness, nums[i] < perm[i] where 0 <= i < nums.length

Example 1

Input: @nums = (1, 3, 5, 2, 1, 3, 1)
Output: 4

One possible permutation: (2, 5, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1) which returns 4 greatness as below:
nums[0] < perm[0]
nums[1] < perm[1]
nums[3] < perm[3]
nums[4] < perm[4]

Example 2

Input: @ints = (1, 2, 3, 4)
Output: 3

One possible permutation: (2, 3, 4, 1) which returns 3 greatness as below:
nums[0] < perm[0]
nums[1] < perm[1]
nums[2] < perm[2]
