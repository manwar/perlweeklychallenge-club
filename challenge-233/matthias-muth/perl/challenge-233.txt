Task 1: Similar Words
Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar

You are given an array of words made up of alphabets only.
Write a script to find the number of pairs of similar words. Two words are similar if they consist of the same characters.
Example 1

Input: @words = ("aba", "aabb", "abcd", "bac", "aabc")
Output: 2

Pair 1: similar words ("aba", "aabb")
Pair 2: similar words ("bac", "aabc")

Example 2

Input: @words = ("aabb", "ab", "ba")
Output: 3

Pair 1: similar words ("aabb", "ab")
Pair 2: similar words ("aabb", "ba")
Pair 3: similar words ("ab", "ba")

Example 3

Input: @words = ("nba", "cba", "dba")
Output: 0


Task 2: Frequency Sort
Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar

You are given an array of integers.
Write a script to sort the given array in increasing order based on the frequency of the values. If multiple values have the same frequency then sort them in decreasing order.
Example 1

Input: @ints = (1,1,2,2,2,3)
Ouput: (3,1,1,2,2,2)

'3' has a frequency of 1
'1' has a frequency of 2
'2' has a frequency of 3

Example 2

Input: @ints = (2,3,1,3,2)
Ouput: (1,3,3,2,2)

'2' and '3' both have a frequency of 2, so they are sorted in decreasing order.

Example 3

Input: @ints = (-1,1,-6,4,5,-6,1,4,1)
Ouput: (5,-1,4,4,-6,-6,1,1,1)
