## Perl

* [Task 1](perl/ch-1.pl)

Sample output
```
$ perl/ch-1.pl
Example 1:
Input: @ints = (3, 2, 1, 4)
Output: (3, 2)
The minimum is 1 and maximum is 4 in the given array. So (3, 2) are neither min nor max.

Example 2:
Input: @ints = (3, 1)
Output: -1

Example 3:
Input: @ints = (2, 1, 3)
Output: (2)
The minimum is 1 and maximum is 3 in the given array. So (2) is neither min nor max.
```

* [Task 2](perl/ch-2.pl)

Sample output
```
$ perl/ch-2.pl
Example 1:
Input: @list = ("7868190130M7522", "5303914400F9211", "9273338290F4010")
Output: 2

The ages of the passengers in the given list are 75, 92, and 40.
So we have 2 senior citizens.

Example 2:
Input: @list = ("1313579440F2036", "2921522980M5644")
Output: 0

The ages of the passengers in the given list are 20 and 56.
So we have no senior citizens.

Example 3:
Input: @list = ("5188675309F6002")
Output: 1

The age of the passenger in the given list is 60.
So we have 1 senior citizen.
