Task 1: Similar Words

Submitted by: [43]Mohammad S Anwar
     __________________________________________________________________

   You are given an array of words made up of alphabets only.

   Write a script to find the number of pairs of similar words. Two words
   are similar if they consist of the same characters.

Example 1

Input: @words = ("aba", "aabb", "abcd", "bac", "aabc")
Output: 2

Pair 1: similar words ("aba", "aabb")
Pair 2: similar words ("bac", "aabc")

Example 2

Input: @words = ("aabb", "ab", "ba")
Output: 3

Pair 1: similar words ("aabb", "ab")
Pair 2: similar words ("aabb", "ba")
Pair 3: similar words ("ab", "ba")

Example 3

Input: @words = ("nba", "cba", "dba")
Output: 0
