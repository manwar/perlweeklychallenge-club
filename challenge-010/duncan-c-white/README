Challenge 1: "Write a script to encode/decode Roman numerals. For example,
given Roman numeral CCXLVI, it should return 246. Similarly, for decimal
number 39, it should return XXXIX."

My notes: That's a nice problem, let's have a go.


Challenge 2: "Write a to find Jaro-Winkler distance between two strings."

My notes:

WTF is Jaro-Winkler, read wikipedia page, well Jaro-Winkler is a simple prefix
adjustment to the Jaro distance, but the wikipedia page explaining Jaro distances
is not very clear - it describes it in terms of matched characters and transposed
characters, but it's description of matching within a range, and of how to count
transposed characters is almost completely unclear.  I couldn't write code based
on such a poor description!

But googling further, Rosetta Stone had various implementations in various
languages (including C and Perl), which clarifies the terribly unclear wikipedia
entry.  Ok, I basically understand it now.  Transposed characters are matching
characters that are diferent, eg TH vs HT

So I'll have a go anyway.
