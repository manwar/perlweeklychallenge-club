# Perl Weekly Challenge 321 Solutions

Perl and Python implementations for both tasks of Weekly Challenge 321.

## Task 1: Distinct Average

Repeatedly remove the current minimum and maximum values, compute their
average, and return the count of distinct averages.

- **Perl (`perl/ch-1.pl`)**: Sorts the list and records distinct pair-sums.
- **Python (`python/ch-1.py`)**: Uses `Fraction` for exact averages and counts
  distinct results.

## Task 2: Backspace Compare

Treat `#` as backspace and compare the resulting strings.

- **Perl (`perl/ch-2.pl`)**: Applies backspaces using a stack and compares the
  final strings.
- **Python (`python/ch-2.py`)**: Uses an equivalent stack approach.

## Running the Solutions

- **Perl**: `perl perl/ch-1.pl` or `perl perl/ch-2.pl`
- **Python**: `python3 python/ch-1.py` or `python3 python/ch-2.py`
- Each script runs only the official example cases as unit tests.
