# Perl Weekly Challenge 354 Solutions

Perl and Python implementations for both tasks of Weekly Challenge 354.

## Task 1: Min Abs Diff

Find all pairs of elements with the minimum absolute difference.

- **Perl (`perl/ch-1.pl`)**: Sorts and collects adjacent pairs matching the
  smallest gap, with Test::More example tests.
- **Python (`python/ch-1.py`)**: Same sorted-adjacent approach with `unittest`
  tests from the spec.

## Task 2: Shift Grid

Shift an `m x n` matrix to the right `k` times with wrap-around between rows.

- **Perl (`perl/ch-2.pl`)**: Shifts the flattened array by `k mod (m*n)` and
  reshapes, with Test::More example tests.
- **Python (`python/ch-2.py`)**: Same flatten/rotate/reshape approach with
  `unittest` tests from the spec.

## Running the Solutions

- **Perl**: `perl perl/ch-1.pl` or `perl perl/ch-2.pl`
- **Python**: `python3 python/ch-1.py` or `python3 python/ch-2.py`
- Each script runs only the official example cases as unit tests.
