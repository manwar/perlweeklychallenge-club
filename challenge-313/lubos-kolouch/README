# Perl Weekly Challenge 313 Solutions

Perl and Python implementations for both tasks of Weekly Challenge 313.

## Task 1: Broken Keys

Check whether the typed string could be produced from the intended string when
some characters may be long-pressed (repeated).

- **Perl (`perl/ch-1.pl`)**: Two-pointer scan over `name` and `typed`.
- **Python (`python/ch-1.py`)**: Same two-pointer logic with `unittest` examples.

## Task 2: Reverse Letters

Reverse only alphabetic characters in the string, leaving other characters in
place.

- **Perl (`perl/ch-2.pl`)**: Two-pointer swap skipping non-letters.
- **Python (`python/ch-2.py`)**: Same approach using `str.isalpha()`.

## Running the Solutions

- **Perl**: `perl perl/ch-1.pl` or `perl perl/ch-2.pl`
- **Python**: `python3 python/ch-1.py` or `python3 python/ch-2.py`
- Each script runs only the official example cases as unit tests.
