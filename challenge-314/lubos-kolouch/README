# Perl Weekly Challenge 314 Solutions

Perl and Python implementations for both tasks of Weekly Challenge 314.

## Task 1: Equal Strings

Delete rightmost characters to make three strings equal, returning the minimum
number of deletions (or `-1` if no non-empty common prefix exists).

- **Perl (`perl/ch-1.pl`)**: Computes the longest common prefix and sums trims.
- **Python (`python/ch-1.py`)**: Same approach with type annotations.

## Task 2: Sort Column

Given equal-length strings, count columns that must be deleted so every column
is lexicographically sorted top-to-bottom.

- **Perl (`perl/ch-2.pl`)**: Checks each column for any descending adjacent pair.
- **Python (`python/ch-2.py`)**: Same column scan with `unittest` examples.

## Running the Solutions

- **Perl**: `perl perl/ch-1.pl` or `perl perl/ch-2.pl`
- **Python**: `python3 python/ch-1.py` or `python3 python/ch-2.py`
- Each script runs only the official example cases as unit tests.
