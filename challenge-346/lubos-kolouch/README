# Perl Weekly Challenge 346 Solutions

Perl and Python implementations for both tasks of Weekly Challenge 346.

## Task 1: Longest Parenthesis

Determine the length of the longest valid parenthesis substring contained
within an input built from `(` and `)`.

- **Perl (`perl/ch-1.pl`)**: Uses a stack of indices with type-checked input
  to track unmatched parentheses and compute the maximum span.
- **Python (`python/ch-1.py`)**: Mirrors the stack-based pass with explicit
  type hints and `unittest` coverage for the specification data.

## Task 2: Magic Expression

Insert `+`, `-`, and `*` between the digits of the supplied string so the
expression evaluates to the target integer.

- **Perl (`perl/ch-2.pl`)**: Performs depth-first search with precedence-aware
  bookkeeping, returning every lexicographically sorted solution.
- **Python (`python/ch-2.py`)**: Applies the same backtracking strategy with
  typed helpers and unit tests bound to the official examples.

## Running the Solutions

- **Perl**: `perl perl/ch-1.pl` or `perl perl/ch-2.pl`
- **Python**: `python3 python/ch-1.py` or `python3 python/ch-2.py`
- Each script runs only the official example cases as unit tests.
