# Perl Weekly Challenge 318 Solutions

Perl and Python implementations for both tasks of Weekly Challenge 318.

## Task 1: Group Position

Find all groups of three or more identical consecutive letters in the string.
The examples return the group substrings; if none exist, the output is empty.

- **Perl (`perl/ch-1.pl`)**: Uses a regex to extract repeated-letter groups.
- **Python (`python/ch-1.py`)**: Uses `re.finditer` to collect groups.

## Task 2: Reverse Equals

Return true if the source array can be made equal to the target array by
reversing exactly one contiguous subarray.

- **Perl (`perl/ch-2.pl`)**: Reverses the mismatching slice and compares.
- **Python (`python/ch-2.py`)**: Finds the mismatch window and reverses it.

## Running the Solutions

- **Perl**: `perl perl/ch-1.pl` or `perl perl/ch-2.pl`
- **Python**: `python3 python/ch-1.py` or `python3 python/ch-2.py`
- Each script runs only the official example cases as unit tests.
